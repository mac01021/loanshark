The Little Loanshark
====================

A simple mortgage calculator you can hold in your hand.


Easy to use:

- Just check the box next to the value you want to compute, and then tweak the other values to see what happens.
- Swipe left and right to compare mortgages with different parameterizations.

Disclaimer
----------
This is a hastily coded implementation of formulae that I derived on a napkin
during my lunch break.  Making financial decisions based solely on numbers from
The Little Loanshark is unwise, and I take no responsibility for the
consequences of any such decision you might make.

The formulae used by The Little Loanshark almost differ from those used in 
real-world loan computations by actual lenders.  

The formulae used by The Little Loanshark may contain errors.


Known Bugs and Missing Features
-------------------------------

I will address these eventually, most likely.

- The rate of interest is not yet a valid target for computation.
- The mortgage data you enter are not persisted. If you navigate away from a mortgage, there is no guarantee that it will be there when you come back.
- The formulae may contain some sloppiness wherein the last payment is smaller than all the others and those others have the reported size.
